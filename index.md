<img src="/images/chenyilan.JPG" align="left" width="200px" style="margin-right:20px" alt="Yilan's picture" title="Yilan."/>
I am a second-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at University of California San Diego (UCSD). I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Tsui-Wei (Lily) Weng](https://lilywenglab.github.io/). 
<!-- Before that, I spent some time as a research intern at [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/), advised by Prof. [Richard Xu](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/yida.xu) and [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/).  -->
I received my master of science degree from UCSD and bachelor of engineering degree from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/). 
<!-- Here is my [CV](/files/CV_Yilan_Chen.pdf).  -->

## Research Interests


<!-- I am interested in theoretical machine learning and its applications, especially  -->
My current research interests are theoretical machine learning and its applications, with a focus on deep learning theory (optimization, generalization, and robustness). My research goal is to establish theoretical foundations for modern deep learning models and develop principled algorithms for real-world applications.

<!-- My research aims to bridge the gap between theory and applications of machine learning by establishing theoretical foundations for modern deep learning models and developing principled algorithms for real-world applications. -->

Interested topics: 
- Deep learning theory (optimization, generalization, robustness)
- Theory for large language models and foundation models
- Principled algorithms for real-world applications

Feel free to drop me an email if you would like to collabrate or have a discussion!
<!-- - Reinforcement learning theory -->
