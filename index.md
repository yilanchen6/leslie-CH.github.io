I am a second-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at University of California San Diego (UCSD). I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Tsui-Wei (Lily) Weng](https://lilyweng.github.io/). 
<!-- Before that, I spent some time as a research intern at [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/), advised by Prof. [Richard Xu](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/yida.xu) and [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/).  -->
I received my master of science degree from UCSD and bachelor of engineering degree from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/). 
<!-- Here is my [CV](/files/CV_Yilan_Chen.pdf).  -->

<!-- `I am looking for a Ph.D. position starting from 2022.` -->
