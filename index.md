<img src="/images/chenyilan.jpg" align="left" width="200px" style="margin-right:20px" alt="Yilan's picture" title="2019 at Beijing."/>
I am a seconed-year master student in [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at University of California San Diego. I'm very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Tsui-Wei (Lily) Weng](https://lilyweng.github.io/) and Dr. [Lam M. Nguyen](https://lamnguyen-mltd.github.io/). 
<!-- Before that, I spent some time as a research intern at [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/), advised by Prof. [Richard Xu](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/yida.xu) and [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/).  -->
I received my Bachelor of Engineering Degree from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/). 
Here is my [CV](https://chenyilan.net/files/CV_Yilan_Chen.pdf). 

`I am looking for a Ph.D. position starting from 2022.`
